Introduction (Shuvo): We had the privilege of going to a field trip in Sylhet on March 2018 thanks to our honorable faculty AIY.
It was an enlightening experience for us. The goal was to survey the surrounding area of Radha Nagar and,
choose a place for rebranding. The place we choose and our choice had to be viable for Radha Nagar.
It had to be something that would be long term and sustainable for Radha Nagar.
Our choice was a fruit processing factory. That would bring employment and refreshing changes to the place.


Why we chose what we chose && reason for choosing the location (MrScX): Radha Nagar has an abundance of lemon, pineapple, banana.
almost all houses have orchards of lemon/pineapple/lemon. Also, Radha Nagar is full of enthusiastic people who wants work and make
a living for themselves. For this reason we choose fruit processing factory as our project, as these two are the main things needed
to run such a factory.


What we need for what we choose (Shames): Chemicals, machinary, Fruits, workers.


How it'll help Radha Nagar (Subir): income will rise, Village will be unnoto the factory will do that for its own needs.
Kosto kombe, as they won't have to go to the town to sell their stuff. Chaa bagan er ek torfo jinish kombe.


Making our project sustainable (waste management, water collection && purification) {Abanto} : Mainly organic waste,
Which we can provide to farmers. Water coagulation to remove iron. Low cost and effective.


Conclusion (Abanto): 2 Line;
